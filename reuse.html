            <p>There’s someone out there who would love to have them. A garage sale is a great way to clean out your space and help reuse all the items you don’t want. You can make a little money too. And when the sale is done, box up anything that didn’t sell and donate what’s left to a local charity. Many of them will come to your house to make a pickup.</p>
