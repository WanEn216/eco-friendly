                    <h2>Prevent Food Waste</h2>
                    <p>Most people don't realize how much food they throw away every day — from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce to parts of fruits and vegetables that could be eaten or repurposed. Preventing food from going to waste is one of the easiest and most powerful actions you can take to save money and lower your environmental footprint by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving natural resources.</p>

                    <h2>Educate Others</h2>
                    <p>Environmental education (EE) connects us to the world around us, teaching us about both natural and built environments.  EE raises awareness of issues impacting the environment upon which we all depend, as well as actions we can take to improve and sustain it. Whether we bring nature into the classroom, take students outside to learn, or find impromptu teachable moments on a nature walk with our families, EE has many benefits for youth, educators, schools, and communities.</p>
