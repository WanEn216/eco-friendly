        <h2>Corrugated cardboard, milk jug style containers, newspaper and inserts, and tin and aluminium cans can all go in your Rogue Disposal & Recycling red-lid cart to be recycled.</h2>
        <h2><i style="color: rgb(63, 164, 78);">But what happens to those items down the road?</i></h2>
        <div class="items">
            <ul>
                <li>Corrugated cardboard is recycled into paper bags, paperboard (like boxes for detergent, cereal, tissue and shoes), new cardboard and even the squiggly middle part of corrugated cardboard.</li>
                <li>The plastic in milk jug style containers is turned into plastic lumber for decking, buckets, Frisbees, storage tubs, new plastic bottles and stadium seats!</li>
                <li>Newspaper is one of the easiest-to-recycle and most-recycled materials. Yesterday’s news gets turned into egg cartons, building insulation, paper plates, kitty litter, construction paper, phone books, sheetrock and new newspaper.</li>
                <li>When you put tin and aluminium cans in the recycling cart, they are taken to a plant where they can be reprocessed into a variety of new products. Keeping them out of the landfill and continuing their useful life. Old cans might become new cans, or they may be changed into things like bike frames or asphalt roadway.</li>
