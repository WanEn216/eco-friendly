      <p>When sunlight hits a solar panel, the light energy is converted into electricity. </p>
      <p>This process is known as the photovoltaic (PV) effect, which is why solar panels are also called photovoltaic panels, PV panels or PV modules.</p>
      <p>Solar panels respond to both direct sunlight coming straight from the sun and diffuse sunlight reflected from particles in clouds and the atmosphere. Solar panels are usually able to generate some electricity even on a cloudy day. However, most electricity is produced on clear days when direct sunlight hits the panels.</p>

      <p>Ecobags provide a clean, safe, and eco-friendly alternative.</p>
      <p>With Ecobags, the humble paper bag has been redesigned into a tough, reusable tote that offers a potential cottage industry for poor city-dwellers. Ecobags employ an innovative design that recycles simple materials and can be cheaply and easily assembled en masse.</p>
      <p>The durable and reusable bags can be mass-produced by self-help groups in common facility centers, and then sold to the public.</p>

      <p>A sustainable and biodegradable solution to single-use plastic, have emerged as a symbol of environmental consciousness</p>
      <p>Bamboo straws are entirely natural, growing without the need for harmful pesticides or chemicals. The bamboo undergoes a thorough process of steam cleaning and pressure washing. Unlike metal straws, bamboo straws do not conduct heat from hot drinks, reducing the risk of burning your mouth.</p>
